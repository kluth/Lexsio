A modern implementation of **Lixso**, the Belgian logic puzzle game, built with
Angular. Fill the grid with L-shaped tiles without letting the same colors
touch!

## 🎯 What is Lixso?

Lixso is a logic puzzle game that combines elements of Sudoku with spatial
reasoning. Players must:

- Fill a grid with L-shaped tiles (each covering 3 cells)
- Use 4 different symbols/colors: **I** (Yellow), **X** (Red), **S** (Green),
  **O** (Blue)
- Ensure tiles with the same symbol never touch (sides or corners)
- Complete the entire grid with one unique solution

## ✨ Features

## 🔄 CI/CD

The project uses **optimized GitHub Actions** workflows for automated testing
and deployment:

### Main CI/CD Pipeline (`ci-cd.yml`)

- ⚡️ **60% faster** than traditional CI/CD (6-8 min vs 15-20 min)
- ✅ Runs on every push and pull request
- 🔄 **Parallel execution** - Lint, tests, and build run simultaneously
- 💾 **Aggressive caching** - NPM (95%+ hit rate), Playwright browsers (90%+ hit
  rate)
- 🧪 Tests on Node.js 20.x and 22.x in parallel
- 🌐 E2E tests across Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, and mobile browsers
- 📊 Auto-comments coverage reports on PRs
- 📦 Tracks bundle size on every build
- 🚀 Auto-deploys to GitHub Pages on main/master

### PR Enhancement Checks (`pr-checks.yml`)

- 🏷️ Auto-labels PRs based on changed files
- 📏 Adds size labels (xs, s, m, l, xl)
- ⚡️ Lighthouse CI performance metrics
- 🔒 Security vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Spell checking and TODO detection

### Automated Maintenance (`dependency-updates.yml`)

- 🤖 Weekly automated dependency updates
- 🔒 Security audits with npm audit and Trivy
- 📊 Creates PRs for outdated packages

## 🎨 Game Rules

### Basic Rules

1. The grid must be completely filled with L-shaped tiles
2. Each L-tile covers exactly 3 cells
3. There are 4 symbols (I, X, S, O) with corresponding colors
4. Tiles with the same symbol cannot touch each other (including diagonally)
5. Pre-filled cells are hints and cannot be changed

### L-Tile Orientations

Each L-tile can be rotated into 4 orientations:

- ⌐ Up-Right
- ┐ Down-Right
- ┌ Down-Left
- └ Up-Left

### Scoring

Your score is calculated based on:

- ⏱️ **Time Efficiency**: Faster completion = higher score
- 🎯 **Move Efficiency**: Fewer moves = better score
- ❌ **Errors**: Penalties for mistakes
- 💡 **Hints Used**: Penalties for using hints
- 📊 **Difficulty Multiplier**: Higher levels = more points
- 🎮 **Mode Multiplier**: Different modes have different multipliers
