# Research Findings for Lixso

## Game Overview

Lixso is a logic puzzle game. It can be played solo or with 2-4 players. The primary objective is to fill a grid with L-shaped tiles.

## Core Concepts

*   **Grid:** The game is played on a grid of cells.
*   **L-tiles:** The main game pieces are L-shaped tiles of four different colors, corresponding to the symbols I, X, S, and O. Each tile covers three cells.
*   **Pre-filled Cells:** Some puzzles may have pre-filled cells that constrain the placement of tiles.

## Rules

1.  **Objective:** The main goal is to completely fill the grid using L-shaped tiles.
2.  **Tile Placement:** The symbols/colors are always placed in an L-shape, covering three identical cells/symbols.
3.  **Respect Pre-filled Cells:** If the grid has pre-filled cells, these must be respected, meaning a blue L-tile must cover a blue cell, a green L-tile a green cell, and so on.
4.  **No Touching Rule:** L-tiles of the same color cannot touch each other, neither by a side nor by a corner.
5.  **Grid Coverage:** The grid must be filled completely with L-tiles.
6.  **Number of Tiles:** Typically, you use 27 out of 28 L-shaped tiles to cover all 81 squares of the grid.
