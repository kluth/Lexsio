# Lixso Game Development Plan

This plan outlines the steps to create the Lixso game, based on the research findings. The development is divided into four phases, starting with the core gameplay and progressively adding more features.

## Phase 1: Core Game Logic and Basic UI

This phase focuses on building the fundamental components of the game.

*   **Step 1: Project Setup**
    *   Initialize a new project (e.g., using a web framework like React, Vue, or a game engine like Godot or Unity).
    *   Set up the basic project structure (folders for source code, assets, etc.).
    *   Install necessary dependencies.

*   **Step 2: Implement the Game Grid**
    *   Create a component to represent the game grid.
    *   The grid should be customizable in size.
    *   Implement the logic for pre-filled cells.

*   **Step 3: Implement L-Tiles**
    *   Create a component to represent the L-shaped tiles.
    *   Tiles should have different colors.

*   **Step 4: Implement Tile Placement Logic**
    *   Implement the logic for placing tiles on the grid.
    *   Allow players to rotate and flip tiles.
    *   Implement drag-and-drop or click-to-place functionality.

*   **Step 5: Implement Game Rules**
    *   Implement the rule that L-tiles of the same color cannot touch.
    *   Implement the rule that the grid must be completely filled.
    *   Implement a win condition check.

*   **Step 6: Basic UI for the Game**
    *   Create a basic user interface to display the game grid, tiles, and game status (e.g., time elapsed, number of moves).
    *   Add basic controls for the game (e.g., buttons to restart, go to the main menu).

## Phase 2: Game Modes

This phase focuses on implementing different game modes to enhance replayability.

*   **Step 7: Implement Classic Puzzle Mode**
    *   Create a set of pre-designed puzzles with increasing difficulty.
    *   Implement a level selection screen.

*   **Step 8: Implement Time Attack Mode**
    *   Implement a timer that counts down.
    *   The player has to solve the puzzle within the given time.
    *   Add a scoring system based on the time taken.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

This phase adds more advanced features to the game.

*   **Step 9: Implement a Hint System**
    *   Create a system that can provide hints to the player.
    *   Hints could reveal the correct position of a tile or highlight an error.

*   **Step 10: Implement a Level Editor**
    *   Create a tool that allows players to create their own puzzles.
    *   Players should be able to place pre-filled cells and define the puzzle solution.
    *   Implement a way to save and share created levels.

## Phase 4: Polish and Finalization

This phase focuses on polishing the game and preparing it for release.

*   **Step 11: Add an Interactive Tutorial**
    *   Create a tutorial that guides new players through the rules and controls of the game.

*   **Step 12: Implement Customizable Themes**
    *   Allow players to change the visual appearance of the game (e.g., colors, tile styles).

*   **Step 13: Add Sound Effects and Music**
    *   Add sound effects for game actions (e.g., placing a tile, winning the game).
    *   Add background music.

*   **Step 14: Final Testing and Bug Fixing**
    *   Conduct thorough testing of all game features.
    *   Fix any bugs or issues found during testing.
